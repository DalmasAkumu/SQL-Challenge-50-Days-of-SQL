# SQL-Challenge-50-Days-of-SQL
I created this repository to help me master SQL through a structured 50-day challenge. Each day, i'll tackle a new SQL problem designed to improve my understanding of databases, queries, and advanced SQL concepts. I believe this challenge will significantly enhance my SQL proficiency.
